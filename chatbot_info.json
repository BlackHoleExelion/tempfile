Our primary objective was to identify optimal stimulation sites within the premotor cortex, a region conventionally associated with this mental disorder. However, to choose and optimize the targeting point of brain was always a challenge to us. To achieve this, I explored two different methodologies:  1. Centralized Targeting Approach:     We initially targeted the center of the cortex across all patients.  2. Individualized Targeting Approach:     Subsequently, we adopted a more personalized strategy, utilizing baseline MRI scans to pinpoint the specific hotspot on the cortex for each patient.  Our comprehensive analysis, encompassing extensive data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, as well as rigorous data processing, demonstrated a marked difference in outcomes between the two approaches. Employing statistical methods, particularly T-tests, we found that the individualized targeting approach yielded significantly superior performance.  In my role, I took charge of the entire data lifecycle, overseeing ETL processes, executing sophisticated data processing techniques, conducting robust statistical analyses, and presenting findings through effective data visualization. This  responsibility allowed me to contribute substantially to the project's success and underscored my proficiency in managing complex data science workflows.  ------------------------------------------  The latest paper of our team was publish on Journal Nature recently. In summary, our study explored the use of a non-invasive brain stimulation technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for treating depression. We focused on a specific brain region called the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and used advanced imaging processing techniques, statistical approaches and machine learning methodologies to understand how TMS affects this area. Our findings indicate that the stronger the response in the sgACC to the stimulation, the better the improvement in depression symptoms. This suggests that we not only confirmed the engagement of sgACC during TMS but also demonstrated its clinical relevance in treating depression. This research provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of TMS and opens new possibilities for personalized depression treatments.  --------------------------------------------  In my previous role as a data scientist, I encountered a challenging situation while working on image processing using a MATLAB tool developed by a former colleague who had left the team years ago. The task was to denoise data, and despite my efforts, the execution of the tool terminated automatically without raising any error. Given the complexity of the code, which was more than 1000 lines, and my limited knowledge in MATLAB programming back then, I found myself in a difficult position. After 2 unsuccessful attempts at debugging the code independently, I realized the need to seek assistance from a senior programmer in a different team. Despite not specializing in data processing, this colleague possessed exceptional MATLAB programming skills, which I believed could shed light on the issue. We scheduled a collaborative session to review the code together. Going through the script line by line, eventually, we identified a subtle but crucial data type issue that had not been apparent during my earlier attempts. This was the root cause of the error I faced. The collaborative effort not only resolved the issue at hand but also served as a valuable learning experience. This encounter reinforced the importance of seeking input from experienced peers and leveraging the collective knowledge within a team to overcome challenges effectively."
